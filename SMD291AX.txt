Controleo3 Profile  // This must be the first item in the file

// Notes:
// 1. Comment lines can start with # or //
// 2. Comments can start after a token (e.g. Door close 1s // Close the oven door in 1 second)
// 3. Tokens are case-insensitive
// 4. End of line character can be CR or LF (or both, in any order)
// 5. Number delimiters can be any non-digit character (30/40/50 = 30,40,50 = 30 40 50)
// 6. When reading in profile files, Arduino's Serial Monitor will show debugging information


// The name of this profile
Name "ChipQuik SMD291AX"
// The title is displayed in the top-left corner
Title "Reflow"
// Show a graph, including the liquidus temperature
Show graph to 260C for 600 seconds
Graph divider at 175C
// The deviation (in Celsius) above which to abort
Deviation to abort 25C
// The maximum temperature.  If exceeded, reflow will abort and the oven door opened
Maximum temperature 260C
// Set a maximum duty cycle to avoid damage to your oven (bottom/top/boost)
Maximum duty 100/75/60


// Close the oven door if it isn't already
Close door over 1 second
// Turn the convection fan on
Convection fan on
// Turn the cooling fan off
Cooling fan off
// Stop the timer for now, until the temperature is above 50C
Stop timer
// Wait for the oven to cool to get consistent results
Display "Waiting for oven to cool to 50~C"
Wait until below 50C

// Start the reflow
Display "Phase: Pre-soak"
// Turn on elements for a short while to heat them up
Element duty cycle 80/50/25
Wait until above 75C

// The heating elements typically take some time to heat up, so it is best to
// zero-base the reflow to a higher temperature.  The graph in the datasheet shows
// 75C after 15 seconds, so that's what we do here
Initialize timer to 15 seconds 
Start plotting at 15 seconds
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/80/60
// Continue ramping up the temperature using PID
Ramp temperature to 150C in 105s

// Start the soak phase
Display "Phase: Soak"
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/50/20
// Slow increase in temperature during soak
Ramp temperature to 183C in 30s

// Start the reflow phase
Display "Phase: Reflow (boost)"
// Force the elements on for a short while to get a quick increase in
// the temperature of the elements (bottom/top/boost)
// This will be limited by the "Maximum duty" command above
Element duty cycle 100/100/100
Wait for 10 seconds
Display "Phase: Reflow"
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/80/60
// Ramp up the temperature for reflow
Ramp temperature to 230C in 45s

// Hold the temperature at peak for a few seconds
Display "Phase: Reflow (hold)"
// Maintain peak temperature for a short while
Maintain 235C for 30 seconds
// Stop the timer so we know how long the reflow took
Stop timer
// Turn the elements off now (bottom/top/boost)
